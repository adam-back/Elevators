# Elevators
Solution to Kuali Financial's elevator coding exercise.

I normally like to take the steps, but thanks for the elevator problem!

Elevators belong inside buildings. The building handles requests from passengers and finds them an elevator; as such, the building makes sure that elevators don't go above or below what is physically possible. Individual elevators move and report their whereabouts/pickups/dropoffs.

Please see [REQUIREMENTS.md](REQUIREMENTS.md) for more notes.
